### What's new in Android Studio (Android Dev Summit 2019)

Welcome to our session on what's new in Android Studio. Today we're going to talk about all the latest features inside Android Studio, plus take a deep dive into something you heard about during the Android Dev Summit keynotes. As a framework session today, we talk about features that available in stable today, all the way to the features you find in Canary channel. To get us up to speed, let's take a quick step back. 

At Google IO, we launched Android Studio 3.5 into Beta. There we focus on system health, feature polish and bug backlog. Just this past month, we launched Android Studio 3.6 into the Beta channel. That has things like ViewBinding support, emulator with integrated Google Maps, design tool improvements, and Kotlin&JNI support. And today, we're excited to talk about Android Studio 4.0.
